# Python Dev Community Ansible Deployment Scripts

The Python Developers slack community has a number of projects that we
have started. This repository contains our deployment scripts :tada:

Interested in becoming a member? Get your invite here: http://pythondevelopers.herokuapp.com/

## Get Started

Ensure you have a `.pass` file in the root of your project, populated with the ansible password.

### Configure/Deploy PySlackers website

    $ ansible-playbook website.yml

### Configure/Deploy SirBot

TODO!

    $ ansible-playbook sirbot.yml

### Run the deployment for the specific app you want to deploy

> You will need to already have your ssh keys included in our provisioning tasks.
  If you do not then you will need to have an admin run the `provisioning.yml` playbook.

> Before deploying a new app read the app configuration section

Run the deployment.

    $ ansible-playbook -i <inventory> deploy.yml --tags <app>

## Testing

Tests are run via Travis CI's `.travis.yml`. Unit tests can be manually via docker with:

    $ docker run -t -i -v ${PWD}:/data geerlingguy/docker-ubuntu1604-ansible /data/run_tests.sh

Ensure that you have placed the Ansible vault password into `.pass` beforehand.
